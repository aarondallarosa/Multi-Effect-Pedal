# DSP Algorithms Playground

**This repository is a work in progress.**  
Please be patient as I continue to develop and update this project!

The `.cpp` files here are currently intended for testing DSP (Digital Signal Processing) algorithms, and may not reflect the most recent work.  
The `.wav` files are audio examples demonstrating the effects—both dry and processed signals for comparison.

I apologize for any unprofessional filenames or organization—everything will be updated and properly structured as the project evolves.

**Thank you for visiting this repository!**

## Introduction

**To ensure professional-grade audio performance and system stability, my multi-effects pedal project incorporates the JACK Audio Connection Kit for real-time, low-latency signal routing within the embedded Linux environment. I have engineered robust I/O handling, including high-resolution ADC/DAC integration and scalable hardware interfaces, to support a variety of input and output configurations. System performance is rigorously profiled and benchmarked, with continuous measurement of DSP latency, audio throughput, and processor utilization using custom analysis tools and industry-standard profilers. Advanced waveform analysis and debugging techniques—both software-based and via oscilloscopes—are employed to validate signal integrity, refine DSP algorithms, and troubleshoot anomalies at every stage of the signal path. This engineering-driven approach ensures reliable, high-fidelity audio processing optimized for the demands of live performance and creative experimentation.**

## Effects

*A list of the effects will be added as the project develops.*  
Currently, the repository includes 3 digital audio effects based on real analog pedals:
Overdrive (Ibanez TubeScreamer 808)
Delay (MXR Carbon Copy)
Tremolo (Boss TR2)

## Audio Demos

The `Audio Demos` folder contains example outputs for each effect:

- Both unprocessed (<Effect_Name>_Input) and modified (<Effect_Name>_Output) audio signals are included for easy comparison.
