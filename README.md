This is a work in project please be paitent. The cpp files in here are currently for just testing the DSP algorithims and I have yet to update this with my current files.
I will be working on this repositsory in the future.

The wav files are audio examples of the DSP algorithims, with the dry and modified signals.

I apologize for the unprofessional names when I have time I will update this repo and organize everything accordingly.
Thank you for clicking on this link.
