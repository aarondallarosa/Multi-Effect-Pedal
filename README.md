# DSP Algorithms Playground

**This repository is a work in progress.**  
Please be patient as I continue to develop and update this project!

The `.cpp` files here are currently intended for testing DSP (Digital Signal Processing) algorithms, and may not reflect the most recent work.  
The `.wav` files are audio examples demonstrating the effects—both dry and processed signals for comparison.

I apologize for any unprofessional filenames or organization—everything will be updated and properly structured as the project evolves.

**Thank you for visiting this repository!**

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to experimenting with DSP algorithms for audio processing.  
Right now, the code and examples are mostly for testing purposes, but over time, I plan to turn this into a well-organized library of effects and demos.

---

## Effects

*A list of the effects will be added as the project develops.*  
Currently, the repository includes basic algorithms for testing purposes.

---

## Audio Demos

The `Audio Demos` folder contains example outputs for each effect:

- Both unprocessed (<Effect_Name>_Input) and modified (<Effect_Name>_Output) audio signals are included for easy comparison.

---

## Sources

*Relevant sources, references, and inspirations will be listed here.*  
(Feel free to recommend any resources you think would be helpful!)

> *Stay tuned for more updates, improvements, and cleaner code!*
