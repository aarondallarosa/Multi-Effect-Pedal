**This repository is a work in progress.**  
Please be patient as I continue to develop and update this project!
I apologize for this being incomplete, everything will be updated and properly structured as the project evolves.

The `.cpp` files here are currently intended for testing DSP algorithms, and are not updated for my current real-time code.  
The `.wav` files are audio examples demonstrating the effects.


**Thank you for visiting this repository!**

## Introduction

## Effects

_This list of the effects will grow as the project develops._

Currently, the repository includes 3 digital audio effects based on real analog pedals:

- **Overdrive (Ibanez TubeScreamer 808)**
- **Delay (MXR Carbon Copy)**
- **Tremolo (Boss TR2)**

## Audio Demos

The `Audio Demos` folder contains example outputs for each effect:

- Both unprocessed (`<Effect_Name>_Input`) and modified (`<Effect_Name>_Output`) audio signals are included for easy comparison.
